        The data has been collected from a range of sources (see <a href="#datadefinitions" data-uk-smooth-scroll>map notes and data definitions</a> below) and provided anonymously at an aggregate level for this project by Women’s Aid.

        What efforts have been taken to protect womens' anonymity and the confidential locations of refuges?
        </h2>
        <p>
        At no point in the production of this project has any data been shared or visualised which includes any personally identifiable information or any sensitive location based information. All locations and routes refer to the calculated centres of boroughs and the journeys between them at an aggregate level. They do not refer to the locations of refuges or the actual journeys women make (from their home to a refuge). Most boroughs also have more than one refuge.

        What academic literature and rationale underpins this project?
        </h2>
        <p>
        This is a Digital Sociology project, brings together digital technologies with sociological concerns, to enable new ways of knowing social issues. It is primarily technical in nature and has focused on identifying the most effective ways to visualise journeys and movement spatially. The intention was to communicate the diversity of these journeys, to ensure they were intelligible. It is also framed to allow audiences to exlore and understand the data, to interpret specific conclusions from this. The map, code and this website are the output of the dissertation, produced as a form of 'public' sociology.

        </p>
        <p>
        This project draws upon previous studies of domestic abuse migration which adopt Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and other methods to analyse and visualise womens' journeys. It differs from these because it's focus is the communication of existing data and the key message that women travel from every borough to every borough in London to seek refuge. For this reason, this project has been undertaken in collaboration with Women's Aid, who have observed the same patterns in their data for many years. This project would not have been possible without their enthusiasm and expertise in the field.

                <p>
                    A refuge provides a safe house when fleeing domestic abuse, with support from specialist-trained staff. A refuge space (sometimes referred to as a ‘bed space’) is a room, which varies in size, with some designated for a single woman, others to accommodate a woman and her children. Women can be placed in a refuge by calling the <a href="https://www.womensaid.org.uk/information-support/helpline/" target="blank">National Domestic Violence Helpline</a>, which is ran in partnership by Women’s Aid and Refuge. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The refuge space numbers have been aggregated and provided by Women’s Aid from <a href="https://www.womensaid.org.uk/what-we-do/online-information-directories/" target="blank">UK Refuges Online</a>, the national database of domestic abuse services and refuge vacancies run in partnership by Women’s Aid England, Women’s Aid Federation of Northern Ireland, Scottish Women’s Aid and Welsh Women’s Aid. Further information about refuges can be found on the <a href="https://www.womensaid.org.uk/domestic-abuse-directory/" target="blank"> Refuge Directory</a>)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Please note that these figures change on a daily basis and do not represent the actual number of spaces which are being used or an accurate picture of demand for those spaces. The data was correct as of 1st May 2016 to reflect the end of the financial year reported in this project.

                <h1>The National Domestic Violence Helpline</h1>
                <p>
                    This is a Freephone national phone number (0808 2000 247) which provides help and information, including referring women to emergency safe accommodation. It is run in partnership by Women’s Aid and Refuge (see <a href="https://www.womensaid.org.uk/information-support/helpline/" target="blank">Women's Aid website</a> for more information).</p>
                <p>
                    The number of calls cited includes approximately 95% of calls answered by the helpline, where the caller has identified the borough they currently live in (it is not always possible to capture a woman's location if they are calling in a crisis situation). There are also a number of other helplines across London and as such, the numbers of calls only provides an indication of demand for this type of service.

                <h1>Arriving to access refuge</h1>
                <p>
                    Each refuge service in London is asked to enter the details of a woman placed in a vacancy, including their home borough and to provide this to Women’s Aid. However, for 269 women between April 2015 and March 2016, some of the data about their original location is missing, not known or not completed correctly. This includes 77 from inside London. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a result, whilst the total numbers of women arriving in to a borough to seek refuge are accurate, some of their original locations are not known. This means that specific numbers of women seeking refuge within their own borough or from other London boroughs are likely to be higher.

                <h1>Leaving to seek refuge</h1>
                <p>
                    Each refuge service in London is asked to enter the details of a woman placed in a vacancy, including their home borough and to provide this to Women’s Aid. However, for 169 women who moved in to another London borough between April 2015 and March 2016, some of the data about their original location is missing, not known or not completed correctly.

                    It is important to note that this project has not included data for the numbers of women leaving London to access a refuge space. However, some women will of course leave London to access refuge elsewhere in the UK. This is evidenced by <a href="http://csp.sagepub.com/content/35/3/327.abstract" target="blank">Bowstead 2015 </a> whose analysis of 10,000 refuge journeys concluded that there was an overall net migration of women leaving London. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a result, the numbers of women leaving each borough to access refuge will most certainly be higer than they appear to be here.

                <h1>Locations (circles) and movement (arrows)</h1>
                <p>
                
                    The circles do not represent the locations of the refuge services or the homes of women accessing them. Instead, they represent a geographically calculated location for each borough (<a href="https://www.doogal.co.uk/AdministrativeAreas.php" target="blank">taken from here</a>). For the routes leaving each borough (in blue), the longitude has been adjusted (by +0.025 degrees) for clarity. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The arrows represent the direction of the journey. The timing (when they appear) and speed (how long they take to travel) reflect the distance between the start and end points. The further away the origin, the longer the arrow takes to appear and to travel to the destination. They fade away as they get close to the location (code <a href="http://www.tnoda.com/blog/2014-04-02" target="blank">adapted from here</a>)
