        What academic literature and rationale underpins this project?
        </h2>
        <p>
        This is a Digital Sociology project, combining sociological thinking with emerging technologies. It is primarily technical in nature and has focused on identifying the most effective ways to visualise journeys spatially in order to both communicate their complexity and yet ensure they remain intelligible, as well as considering how interaction and animation within geographic visualisation can help audiences exlore data and in doing so, interpret specific messages. The map, code and this website are the output of this project, produced as a form of 'public' sociology.

        </p>
        <p>
        This project draws upon previous studies of domestic abuse migration which adopt mixed-methods approaches, including Geographical Information Systems (GIS), to analyse and visualise womens' journeys. It also differs greatly, in that it's focus is to communicate that women travel from every borough to every borough in London to seek refuge. For this reason, this project has been undertaken in collaboration with Women's Aid, who have observed the same patterns in their data for many years and have extensive experience in the field of domestic abuse. This project would not have been possible without their enthusiasm and expertise.

                <p>
                    A refuge provides a safe house when fleeing domestic abuse, with support from specialist-trained staff. A refuge space (sometimes referred to as a ‘bed space’) is a room, which varies in size, with some designated for a single woman, others to accommodate a woman and her children. Women can be placed in a refuge by calling the <a href="https://www.womensaid.org.uk/information-support/helpline/" target="blank">National Domestic Violence Helpline</a>. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The refuge space numbers have been aggregated and provided by Women’s Aid from <a href="https://www.womensaid.org.uk/what-we-do/online-information-directories/" target="blank">UK Refuges Online</a>, the national database of refuge spaces. Further information about refuge spaces can be found on the <a href="https://www.womensaid.org.uk/domestic-abuse-directory/" target="blank"> Refuge Directory</a>)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Please note that these figures change on a daily basis and do not represent the actual number of spaces which are being used or an accurate picture of demand for those spaces. The data was correct as of 1st May 2016 to reflect the end of the financial year reported in this project.

                <h1>The National Domestic Violence Helpline</h1>
                <p>
                    This is a Freephone national phone number (0808 2000 247) which provides help and information, including referring women to emergency safe accommodation (See <a href="https://www.womensaid.org.uk/information-support/helpline/" target="blank">Women's Aid website</a>more information).</p>
                <p>
                    The number of calls cited includes approximately 95% of calls answered by the helpline, where the caller has identified the borough they currently live in (it is not always possible to capture a woman's location if they are calling in a crisis situation). There are also a number of other helplines across London and as such, the numbers of calls only provides an indication of demand for this type of service.

                <h1>Arriving to access refuge</h1>
                <p>
                    Each refuge service in London is asked to enter the details of a woman placed in a vacancy, including their home borough and to provide this to Women’s Aid. However, for 269 women between April 2015 and March 2016, some of the data about their original location is missing, not known or not completed correctly. This includes 77 from inside London. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a result, whilst the total numbers of women arriving in to a borough to seek refuge are accurate, some of their original locations are not known. This means that specific numbers of women seeking refuge within their own borough or from other London boroughs are likely to be higher.

                <p>
                    Each refuge service in London is asked to enter the details of a woman placed in a vacancy, including their home borough and to provide this to Women’s Aid. However, for 169 women who moved in to another London borough between April 2015 and March 2016, some of the data about their original location is missing, not known or not completed correctly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is also no data currently available or included for those who travel outside of London to access refuge. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a result, the total number of women leaving a borough to seek refuge will likely be much higher.

                <h1>Routes, arrows and circles</h1>
                <p>
                
                    The circles do not represent the locations of the refuge services or the homes of women accessing them. Instead, they represent a geographically calculated location for each borough (<a href="https://www.doogal.co.uk/AdministrativeAreas.php" target="blank">taken from here</a>). For the routes leaving each borough (in blue), the longitude has been adjusted (by +0.025 degrees) for clarity.

                    The arrows represent the direction of the journey. The timing (when they appear) and speed (how long they take to travel) reflect the distance between the start and end points. The further away the origin, the longer the arrow takes to appear and to travel to the destination. They fade away as they get close to the location (code <a href="http://www.tnoda.com/blog/2014-04-02" target="blank">adapted from here</a>)
