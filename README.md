# Domestic-Abuse-Migration-Map
Interactive map of migration routes in London 2015-16 using D3

This project visualises the 1165 journeys women made to seek refuge in London between 1st April 2015 and 31st March 2016. 
It has been designed to illustrate how far and wide women migrate across London boroughs when seeking safety from an abusive partner.

This site has been created by Nissa Ramsay, as part of a Masters in Digital Sociology at Goldsmiths University, in collaboration with Women's Aid to help inform how services are provided for women seeking refuge in future.
